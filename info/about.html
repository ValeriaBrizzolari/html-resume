<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Valeria! Originally from Italy, I now live in England with my two wonderful kids. While currently a stay-at-home mom, I’m also pursuing my passion for web development through a course in front-end and back-end coding. I've always been drawn to web design and Photoshop, and that curiosity has inspired me to dive deeper into building websites from the ground up. When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me immersed in video games—I'm a big fan of World of Warcraft, Counter-Strike 2, PUBG, and Overwatch. I also love cooking, especially creating delicious vegan dishes that reflect my passion for good food and a healthy lifestyle.</p>
